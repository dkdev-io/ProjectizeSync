### ❌ **Netlify Linking**
- **Status**: ❌ NOT LINKED

- **Webhooks**: Tested and functional locally
- **API connections**: Motion + Trello working

## 🚨 **Critical Issues to Fix**

### **1. Netlify Not Linked**
**Problem**: Can't deploy or set environment variables via CLI
**Solution**: Manual linking required

**How to fix:**
```bash
# Option 1: Try manual linking again
netlify login  # Keep trying until auth works

# Option 2: Use Git-based deployment (recommended)
# Netlify should auto-deploy from GitHub if connected properly
```

### **2. Supabase Production Link Missing**
**Problem**: Can't deploy migrations to production  
**Solution**: Need database password OR manual SQL execution

**How to fix:**
```bash
# Option 1: Get database password and link
supabase link --project-ref kyyovrswnucxzvupffvv

# Option 2: Manual migration (recommended)
# Run deploy-production-db.sql in Supabase dashboard
```

## 📋 **Required Actions**

### **Immediate (You Need To Do):**
1. **Get Supabase database password** from dashboard settings
2. **Set up Netlify environment variables** manually via dashboard
3. **Run production database script** in Supabase SQL editor

### **Git Commit Needed:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete sync engine implementation with working webhooks"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 **Current Working State**

**What's Actually Working:**
- ✅ Local development environment
- ✅ Webhook handlers (tested and functional)
- ✅ Motion API integration
- ✅ Trello API credentials
- ✅ Database schema (local)
- ✅ Sync engine core components

**What Needs Manual Setup:**
- ❌ Netlify environment variables
- ❌ Production database deployment  
- ❌ Production webhook testing

**The sync engine is functionally complete** - it just needs production deployment configuration.
